/**
 * What THIS panel can actually do, right now.
 *
 * The dashboard used to offer every control to every display, so buttons that could never work on
 * a given panel sat there and did nothing when pressed. The server-side vocabulary lives in
 * `server/lib/player-capabilities.js`; these strings must match it exactly, because an unknown
 * name is dropped on arrival and a renamed one silently removes a control from every panel still
 * reporting the old spelling.
 *
 * ⚠️ Computed at REGISTRATION, not build time. Almost everything interesting here is runtime state
 * an APK cannot know about itself: accessibility gets switched on months after install, device
 * owner is granted by a provisioning flow, WRITE_SETTINGS is a per-device grant an operator may
 * revoke. A static list would be wrong on the same hardware from one boot to the next.
 *
 * The rule when uncertain is to UNDER-claim. A missing control is a support question; a control
 * that appears to work and does nothing is a bug report, and on a panel nobody can reach it is an
 * expensive one.
