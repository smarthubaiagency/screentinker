/*
 * Date ranges on the report endpoints.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE BUG: all three handlers built the end of the range as `new Date(end + 'T23:59:59')`. That
 * assumes `end` is a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` and glues a time onto it to mean "the whole of that day". Hand
 * it a full ISO timestamp — which is what a client library, a script, or an AI agent calling the
 * documented API naturally sends — and the concatenation produces `2026-09-25T15:53:06.947ZT23:59:59`,
 * an Invalid Date, `NaN`, and a WHERE clause matching no rows.
 *
 * The endpoint then answered **200 with `[]`**. Not an error — "nothing played". That is a plausible
 * enough answer that nobody questions it, which is what makes it worse than a crash. It was found
 * when an agent asked for a week of uptime and was told, convincingly, that every screen had been
 * dark for a week.
 *
 * These tests are on the parsing rule directly, because that is where the bug lived and a route test
 * would need a populated database to notice an empty array is wrong.
