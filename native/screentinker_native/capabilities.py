"""What this panel can actually do — declared on EVERY register (Android PlayerCapabilities.kt).

The server gates each command on these names (server/lib/player-capabilities.js COMMAND_CAPABILITY)
and the dashboard hides controls a panel cannot honour, so a declaration is a promise: never declare
something that silently no-ops. Anything hardware-dependent is PROBED, never assumed — a Pi with no
DSI panel and a TV that ignores DDC has no system brightness, and saying otherwise gives the operator
a slider that does nothing.

server/test/player-parity-baselines.test.js reads CAPABILITIES_ALWAYS from this file; keep it a
plain list literal of strings.
